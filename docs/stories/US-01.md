# US-01: Project Setup & Infrastructure

**Priority:** High (MVP Core)

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to initialize the repository with the chosen stack (Node, Express, React, Postgres, Prisma),
**So that** we have a stable foundation for development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Node/Express backend server is running.
- [ ] **AC2:** React frontend is running and connected to backend.
- [ ] **AC3:** Docker Compose (optional but recommended) or local script sets up Postgres DB.
- [ ] **AC4:** Prisma is initialized and connected to the DB.
